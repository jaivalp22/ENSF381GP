                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>
                    Our milestone is to make sure we have left an everlasting impact on the world 
                    to help those in need, and also to make sure we have changed the course of lives for those
                    who were helped by us. We envision to create a world with a balance between <i>equality</i> and <i>equity</i>!
                    We seek to take the money from the rich, and donate it to the poor and 
                    inspire others to do so as well. <i>Although</i>, we take money from the rich, 
                    we also compensate them with our amazing products!

                    I absolutely loved the black dog! Spicy just to perfection! However, it was a tad bit too spicy, 
                    as my toilet has randomly been incinerated from existence, according to my creepy landlord. 
                    I have also lost nerve cells in my bottom, rendering my behind completely numb. 5 STARS (COMPLETELY WORTH IT)!

                    At first I thought "The Batman" perfume was gonna make me rizzy,
                    but, after I put it on, everyone told me that I wasn't a munch. 
                    So I decided to make a song with it on, and it really popped off #OhioGyatt#IamAMunch

                    informed by my family that there were pictures#ClumsyMe! And why is it sooo long!!!
